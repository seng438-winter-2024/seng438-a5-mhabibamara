# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 
### Result of model comparison (selecting top two models)
For this section, our group chose to work with the C-SFRAT testing tool to test the test data file "CDS.DAT" under the Failure_Count directory. The following models were compared to determine which one aligned/fit mostly with our input failure data:
- IFR Salvia & Bollinger
- IFR generalized Salvia & Bollinger
- S Distribution
- Discrete Weibull (Order 2)
- Discrete Weibull (Type III)
- Geometric
- Negative Binomial (Order 2)
- Truncated Logistic

In the below chart, we can see the original failure and model reliability plot against our two covariates (T,F and (E,F)):

To compare the models, we simply selected the Model Comparison tab which gave us a table with a list of all models. The top two models are the ones we want to look at:

Sorting by log-liklihood, gives us the models in order of how cloself they fit with our failure data. So in our case, DW3(E) and DW3(F) were the closest models to our failure data. 

The Discrete Weibull (DW3) is particularly applicable for modeling failure data measured in discrete units like cycles or shocks. This distribution provides a versatile tool for analyzing scenarios where the timing of events is counted in distinct intervals, making it distinctively useful in fields that deal with discrete data patterns and reliability analysis.

### Result of range analysis (an explanation of which part of data is good for proceeding with the analysis)
In order to select the best models from those that the C-SFRAT gave us, we had to look at the data for the range analysis that would best fit the locations on the failure data graph. We also made sure to look at the log-likelihood column, as previously noted, and discover the two biggest numbers (-398.597 and -403.575). Based on this, we were able to select our two top models, which are shown below. The range was also largely utilized to determine how many failures there were in the dataset, allowing us to generate 140 periods and assess the dependability of the failures that happened inside that time frame.
